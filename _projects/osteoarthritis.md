This research was a group project conducted under [Steele Lab](https://steelelab.me.uw.edu/) under the supervision of Professor Kat Steele.
The goal of this research was to quantitatively analyze the degragation of knee cartilage in osteoarthritis (OA) patients.
A sample of 60 MRI scans, including both healthy and OA affected patients were obtained from a partner hospital, and the sample MRI sets were assigned numbers to omit any bias during data analysis.
Group members then individually processed a total of approximately 400 frames to create splines of the knee cartilage surfaces using Matlab.
The cartilage surfaces were individually reconstructed in Meshlab, and Matlab was used to obtain a comprehensive data of each sample.
Additionally, I contributed in implementing a Matlab script to review the splines in the graphical user interface (GUI).
