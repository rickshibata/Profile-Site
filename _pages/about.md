I'm currently a second-year student pursuing M.S. in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. My concentration is in fluid mechanics and aerothermodynamics. I am particularly interested in experimental and computational methods in analyzing supersonic flows. My current research focuses on flow analysis using plenoptic imaging methods.
