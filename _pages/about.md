I am a recent graduate with a MS in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, with a concentration in aerothermodynamics and fluid mechanics. My graduate research focused on using laser diagnostics to obtain quantitative data from transonic/supersonic flows. Currently, I am interested in pursuing the effective use of both experimental and computational methods to solve challenging engineering problems in the aerospace field.

My home city is Seattle, WA, where I received my dual-degree in BS in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) and a BS in Economics from the University of Washington in 2016. My undergraduate studies and research consisted of finite-element analysis (FEA), material modeling, image processing, manufacturing methods and structural analysis. I was previously associated with the Advanced Propulsion Laboratory at UW, where my research primarily focused on the development of a two-stage penetrator probe system to retrieve samples from the sub-surface of Europa.

Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling to interesting places around the world and exploring nature on backpacking trips. My hobbies include photography, sketching, reading, practicing the bass guitar, scuba diving, and cooking. I enjoy the process of learning new things, and am always picking up new hobbies.
