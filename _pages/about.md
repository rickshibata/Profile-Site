I'm currently a second-year graduate student pursuing M.S. in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. My concentration is in aerothermodynamics and fluid mechanics. I am particularly interested in the use of experimental and computational methods in analyzing supersonic flows.

Outside of school, I enjoy traveling and going out on backpacking trips. My hobbies also include reading, practicing the bass guitar and cooking. I love learning new things to do and am always picking up hobbies.
