My current research focuses on flow imaging methods of transonic and supersonic flows. The research is a joint project with an industry partner involving the implementation of a plenoptic imaging device to acquire 3D flow-field data using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Experiments are conducted on the Mach 1.3 wind tunnel at the [Flowfield Imaging Laboratory](http://research.ae.utexas.edu/FloImLab/) at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Professor Noel Clemens.

The plenoptic imaging device captures instantaneous 3D flow data, as opposed to traditional planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) methods enabling a instantaneous acquisition of volumetric flow data. We are currently working to setup the experiment so we may conduct traditional PLIF measurements which could be compared with the data acquired by the plenoptic device.
