My current research focuses on flow imaging methods of transonic and supersonic flows. The project involves the development and implementation of a plenoptic imaging device, with an industry collaborator, to acquire 3D flowfield data. The research is conducted on the Mach 1.8 wind tunnel at the Flow Imaging Laboratory at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Professor Noel Clemens.

The plenoptic camera attachment in development utilizes a micro-lens array (a series of smaller lenses) to capture the incoming light rays at varying angles, a series of additional optical elements, and software to effectively capture volumetric fluid density of subsonic, transonic and supersonic flows.

The plenoptic device captures instantaneous 3D flow data, as opposed to traditional planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) methods enabling a faster acquisition of volumetric flow data.
