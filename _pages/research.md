My current research focuses on flow imaging methods of transonic and supersonic flows. The project works closely with an industry collaborator to develop and implement a plenoptic imaging device to acquire 3D flow-field data. The research is conducted on the Mach 1.8 wind tunnel at the Flowfield Imaging Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Professor Noel Clemens.

The plenoptic device captures instantaneous 3D flow data, as opposed to traditional planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) methods enabling a instantaneous acquisition of volumetric flow data.
